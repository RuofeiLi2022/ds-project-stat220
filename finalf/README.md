====================Technical Report ====================

We have covered most knowledges we've learned during the term in building this Shiny app. For example, we have used tidyVerse packages to tidy, analyze, and visualize datasets, rvest package to scrape data from internet, data importing with readr, caret with knn and kmeans from base r to conduct statistical learning & predictions, etc. In particular, we have done a LOT of visualizations. We have also learned some basics about HTML, and some handy tricks to manipulate data rows, etc.
